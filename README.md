## Description

This project was my introduction into the Go programming language. I'm excited to continue writing in Golang.

This project is based off of the Galton Board, a board of beads and pegs that demonstrates an example of the Bell Curve in reality. This project aims to simulate a Galton Board by using the *"math/rand"* library and some simulated physical limitations. Enjoy!
